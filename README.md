# Pulse
Beap, Beap, Snap! SnapPulse requires a pulse to see your pics, in a snap!
Pulse leverages the eye's averaging of image information over time to display a picture, while showing a random picture to a camera with a short exposure. To prevent long-exposure and small aperture / low ISO shots, a new version should be made that leverages the way eye's view colors specifically (e.g. using shadows to darken)
